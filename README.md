## AI Code Review

✅ **Code Quality: Excellent!**

The code in both `Hotel.java` and `HotelRoom.java` files appears well-organized, readable, and free of any critical issues regarding functionality, duplicate logic, or magic numbers beyond the scope allowed for testing. All control structures use braces correctly, and there is appropriate use of named constants to avoid magic numbers. The overall logic flow is clear and easy to follow, making it suitable for a high school assignment. 

Keep up the good work! Recommended adjusted grade: 100%
