## AI Code Review

✅ **Code Quality: Excellent!**

Both the `Hotel` and `HotelRoom` classes are well-structured, with clear logic flow and proper use of constants to avoid magic numbers outside the `main()` method. All required braces are in place for control structures, enhancing readability and preventing logical errors.

### Observations:
- **Hotel.java**: The program uses constants from `HotelRoom`, which keeps it free of magic numbers outside the `main()` method. Method logic is clear and well-organized.
- **HotelRoom.java**: All validation logic for room number and bed count is encapsulated in helper methods, reducing duplication effectively. String constants are properly used for default values.

No duplicates or significant issues requiring changes were found in the provided files. Keep up the great work maintaining readability and logical organization!
